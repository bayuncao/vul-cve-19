# Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in `greykite`

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the `greykite` project version `1.0.0`.


[`greykite`](https://github.com/linkedin/greykite) : A flexible, intuitive and fast forecasting library. 

The code in line `313` of the `greykite/framework/templates/pickle_utils.py` file in this project have a function named `load_obj`. The external file is loaded using `dill.load` in 313 lines of code of this function, and since there is no security validation, by constructing a malicious external file it can be loaded normally and commands can be executed.

In the vulnerability replication environment, `model.pkl` in the `a directory` in the repository is a malicious remote command execution file.

**I loaded in a malicious file using a bounce shell in Ubuntu's exploit test environment, which resulted in an RCE.**

I put `a/model.pkl` and `PoC.py` file and validation video for the malicious build in this repository as well.

[`load_obj` function location in the project](https://github.com/linkedin/greykite/blob/dac923738c313e08cef05ae8f7f3891ecc066ba6/greykite/framework/templates/pickle_utils.py#L266)
